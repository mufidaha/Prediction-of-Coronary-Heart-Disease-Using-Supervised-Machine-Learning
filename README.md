# Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Description
This project uses supervised machine learning to predict Coronary Heart Disease from clinical data. It guides you through data preparation, model training, and evaluation to provide hands-on experience in building and understanding models that support early CHD detection.

## Objective
Gain practical experience applying the machine learning lifecycle to create and evaluate models predicting Coronary Heart Disease.

## Features
- Data preprocessing  
- Training multiple supervised learning models  
- Model evaluation and comparison  

## Technologies
- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to follow the workflow step-by-step
